# Node.JS Fundaments

## Overview

This project marks the beginning of my journey into Node.js, representing a hands-on exploration of the technology. In this initial module, I'll be crafting a RESTful API with a primary focus on grasping the fundamentals. What sets this project apart is its deliberate exclusion of external frameworks or libraries, ensuring a thorough dive into the core concepts.

I'll delve into the inner workings of Node.js, gaining insights into its internal modules, including HTTP, Crypto, and File System. Additionally, I'll unravel the essentials of the HTTP protocol. This undertaking is more than just a project; it's my initiation into the world of Node.js, laying the foundation for deeper learning and practical application.


## Key Features

- Implementation of a RESTful API in Node.js.
- Utilization of internal Node.js modules, including HTTP, Crypto, and File System.
- Exploration of HTTP fundamentals: requests, responses, headers, status codes, routing, and query parameters.
- In-depth exploration of Streams in Node.js.
- Practical application of Streams to perform asynchronous and partial operations in the backend.
